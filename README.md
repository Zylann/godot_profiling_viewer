Profiling viewer
===================

This is a viewer for dumps produced by a small profiler I wrote in C++: https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel/blob/master/util/zprofiling.h
It started as a simple "get time before, get time after" method, which I improved to be able to profile specific sections of my module, at minimal overhead.

Please note it is very rough at the moment, as it was only a quick-and-dirty tool for my own use so far.
